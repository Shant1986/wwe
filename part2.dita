        <p><b>Rewritten #1</b></p>
        <p>When a manager initiates the Bonus and Awards to the employee, Workday sends a
            notification to the managers, the compensation administrator, and the employee HR
            partner.</p>
        <p><b> Rewritten #2</b></p>
        <p>Workers can create Spend Authorization and check the approved authorizations of the
            expenses in the Expense Reports.</p>
        <p><b> Rewritten #5</b></p>
        <p>Workday includes all the compensation plans to calculate compensation basis only when the
            compensation element selected on the plan is included in the employeeâ€™s compensation
            grade as a base pay element.</p>
        <p><b> Rewritten #6</b></p>
        <p>Workday calculates the taxes by considering the following during the payroll:</p>
        <ol id="ol_gbn_xvj_nnb">
            <li>The full amount of each taxable component including the imputed earning and the
                pre-tax deduction for each of the jurisdictions.</li>
            <li>Split the pay components according to the defined percentages.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b> Rewritten #8</b></p>
        <p>You can set up the company taxes by location if your workers travel for work in different
            locations. Thus, you can accurately withhold the taxes for the exact time as reported in
            the time tracking or payroll input.</p>
